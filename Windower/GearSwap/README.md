# Windower4 GearSwap scripts

Install the `addon` for `GearSwap`.

Then copy these scripts in to the `data` subfolder.

For example:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Windower4\addons\GearSwap\data
```

## About

Most of these scripts are SUPER simple. The biggest thing I
added (aside from some simple gear that I use for my lvl 75
jobs) is that it auto-equips movespeed gear whenever possible.

On zoning to a major town, it equips the corresponding aketon.
And when playing on THF, it equips movespeed boots whenever
outside of combat.
